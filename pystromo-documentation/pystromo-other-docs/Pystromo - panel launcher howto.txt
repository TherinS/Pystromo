This is a step by step procedure about how to add a Pystromo map file picker
launcher to the top panel and possibly other panels.


** Ubuntu MATE **

- Method one (will work for most distros) -

1. Copy the "pystromo.desktop" file to /home/<username>/.local/share/applications
2. Go into the "Games" menu and right click the launcher and "add to panel"

- Method two (Ubuntu MATE specific) -

1. Right click top panel and choose 'add to panel'.
2. Select 'Custom Application Launcher' and click Add.
3. a. Type: Application
   b. Name: (Name the launcher, i.e. 'Pystromo map chooser'
   c. Command: this will depend on where the launcher .sh file is located.
			Mine is in-
   "/home/steveb/.config/caja/scripts/Pystromo-profile-loader-caja &"
			Yours may be in another folder, where ever your distro likes
			to keep its scripts.  In Nautilus, its in-
	"/home/steveb/.local/share/nautilus/scripts"
	d. Comment: Whatever you want, like "Load Pystromo keymap"
4. You may want to choose an icon for the launcher.  A picture of the
	Nostromo or Razer speedpad would work nicely. I keep a folder 'icons' in
	my Pictures folder for just this sort of action.
